## Part 1: **Summary** {.center}

## What do we mean

• The **summary** criterion will refer to the summary of the sensor you have selected -- **Landset**

##### Landsat imagery {auto-animate="true"}

> Landsat imagery is the longest free temporal image repository of consistent medium resolution data. It collects data at each point on Earth each every **16 days** (temporal resolution) in a raster grid composed of **30 by 30 m cells** (spatial resolution). Geographical analysis and concepts are becoming ever more entwined with remote sensing and Earth observation.

## Overall:

The continuous acquisition of data by Landsat 8, along with its moderate spatial resolution (30 meters for most bands), spectral capabilities, and global coverage, makes it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications in Earth observation and remote sensing.

## Limitation {.center}

### Part 3: reflection? {.center}

## **Limitations:**

1.  **Spatial Resolution:** While Landsat 8 provides valuable data, its spatial resolution (30 meters for most bands) may not be sufficient for certain applications requiring very high detail, such as urban planning at a local scale.

2.  **Temporal Resolution:** Landsat 8 has a revisit time of 16 days, which means it may not capture events or changes on a daily or weekly basis. For some applications, more frequent revisit times are necessary.

3.  

    ## **Limited Spectral Bands:** Landsat 8 has fewer spectral bands compared to some other remote sensing satellites, which limits its ability to capture certain types of information, especially in the infrared and shortwave infrared regions.

4.  **Cloud Cover:** Cloud cover can hinder the acquisition of clear imagery, impacting the availability of data for certain regions and time periods.

5.  **Data Processing:** Analyzing Landsat data requires specialized software and expertise, and the large volume of data can pose challenges for storage and processing.

## Conclusion

-   Despite these limitations, Landsat 8 remains a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, contributing significantly to our understanding of Earth's dynamics and changes over time.
