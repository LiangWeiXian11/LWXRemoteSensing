# Preface {.unnumbered}

I am Liang Weixian from Shenzhen, Guangdong, China. I graduated from South China Agricultural University with a BSc in GIS. Currently, I am working on my MSc in Urban Spatial Science at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis , [CASA](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/), an interdisciplinary institute focusing on the science of cities within the Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment at UCL.

I am very interested in smart cities, especially the current progress of smart cities in Shenzhen and Hong Kong. I am also interested in the Historical Trail in GuangDong Province and quantitative inversion of arable land quality as well as building a website for selling pigs. More specifically, I built an interactive StoryMap in Arcgis online to show the historical origins, current situations and future applications of the [South China Historical Trail's](https://www.nanyueguyidao.cn/). Another interesting aspect for me is the construction of a hyperspectral database of the crop. I can use the Java programming language (with some development frameworks) to build the backend of this database system.

I chose this moodle (Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments) to expand and strengthen my remote sensing knowledge, especially in GEE and Earth Observation image processing, and its application to policy making. I hope to put this knowledge into practice in the future, whether looking for a job or starting my own business.

Finally, this website is my learning diary for one module, Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments, which includes the weekly contents (with points mentioned in lecture and extra study notes!), relevant applications or academic papers, my reflection and some new words or terms.

Thank you for your reading!
