# Week 4 Policy

## Summary

### Shenzhen

In the last forty years, Shenzhen has changed a lot. The city has grown from a small area to a huge one, and many more people now live there. With over 17 million people in an area of 962 square kilometers, it's a bustling city. But, with all this growth, there are also challenges. Shenzhen has to find a balance between growing and taking care of the environment.

1.  Due to the high population density and intense socio-economic activities in Shenzhen, there's significant disruption and pressure on the ecological environment. As a result, the overall fragmentation index of the ecological landscape keeps rising, leading to insufficient ecological connectivity between green spaces. This trend is causing ecological spaces to become isolated and fragmented, and there's an urgent need to enhance the connectivity of ecological corridors.

2.  The distribution of ecological recreational spaces is uneven, and there's a need to improve accessibility and connectivity of facilities. Existing parks face challenges such as limited per capita green space resources and uneven development of green ecology in different areas. The quality and functionality of ecological recreational spaces need improvement. The connectivity of park networks and pedestrian accessibility also need to be enhanced.

### Main policy challenges and targets

The above policy document mentions five areas of challenges. I will briefly describe these main issues in this part and give some possible action plans to address them in the application section.

1.  Improve the quality of inefficient forests and young forests, accurately enhancing forest quality.

    In natural suburban parks, we will nurture and thin out large areas of concentrated young forests to promote forest transformation. This includes promoting tree growth, removing low-quality trees, increasing forest quality and volume, and enhancing forest carbon storage.

2.  Enhance the quality of water conservation forests in important water source areas, strengthening soil and water conservation effects.

    We will carry out forest transformation and nurturing of young forests around water conservation areas to improve the quality of fast-growing artificial forests and young forests.

3.  Promoting urban greening and upgrading greening quality

    Analyze shortcomings in urban greening and identify key areas for the construction of tree-lined roads and vertical greening.

4.  Promoting the construction of boulevards

    Comprehensively promote the construction and nurturing of boulevards on roads whose shade coverage rate does not meet the standards, enhance the coverage rate of boulevards in built-up areas of cities, and promote the linking of boulevards into pieces.

5.  Connecting mountain and water ecological corridor networks

    1.  Connect natural mountain areas and green spaces through ecological green corridors or ecological bridges to promote connectivity of mountain forests and green corridors.

    2.  Utilize nearby lakes and reservoirs along with surrounding mountain forest resources to create a network of suburban trails and lakeside pathways.

Sustainable Development Goals ([SDG](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)) are targets with measurable indicators for monitoring

In this case, this action plan includes the goal 11 and 15, aiming to make local citizens' settlements resilient and sustainable, and protecting our forest and terrestrial ecosystems respectively.

## Application of EO data (to solve the policy challenge)

### Rehabilitation of inefficient forests and middle-aged and young-aged forests to accurately improve forest quality.

Identify inefficient forests and young and middle-aged forests to provide a basis for subsequent accurate improvement of forest quality.

1.  Extraction of large-scale concentrated and continuous young and middle-aged forests by NDVI.

    1.  Calculate ndvi by using the red and near-infrared bands of Landset data.

    2.  Extracting areas with large ndvi values as targets for subsequent improvement.

2.  Identifying poor quality trees

    1.  NDVI can be used to assess the health of vegetation. Since NDVI can be used to reflect the sparseness and growth status of vegetation, the NDVI of poor quality forests is usually lower than that of healthy forests.

    2.  DEM can reflect the slope and height of the terrain. Sometimes, poor-quality forest trees are distributed in areas with steep terrain. Therefore, we can use DEM to assist in identifying poor quality vegetation.

### Improve the quality of water source conservation forests in important water source areas and strengthen the effect of soil and water conservation.

Identify the vegetation around the water protection zone and count the area

1.  We calculate the NDWI for extracting water using Landset data (landset - NDWI)

2.  We extracted vegetation around water zone using NDVI and count the total area

### Promoting urban greening and upgrading greening quality

Calculating the accessibility of green space in each region (per capita) and determining the priority areas for green construction

1.  using landset data to calculate NDVI and extracted vegetation.

2.  Calculating the total area of green space in each region

3.  quantify the green space accessibility\* per capita by network analysis using population raster data and road vector data

### Promoting the construction of boulevards

Identification of roads with substandard shade coverage rate

1.  Identify trees around roads through road vector data and high-precision revolution remote sensing images (smaller than 1M spatial resolution and may collected by drones)

2.  Identify roads with low shade coverage through regional statistics, as a subsequent focus of construction, to improve the coverage of shade roads in urban built-up areas

### Connecting mountain and water ecological corridor networks

Identification of water, forests and green spaces and identification of ecological corridors

1.  We use landset (ndvi, ndwi) and DEM data to extract water bodies, forests and green spaces.

2.  Building cost surface raster (through DEM and urban landuse raster data) in [ArcGIS pro](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview)

3.  Calculate [Least Cost Corridor](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/least-cost-corridor.htm) through (ArcGIS pro) Spatial Analyst toolset.

## Reflection

### Method or theory

1.  **NDVI** (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) is an index which can be used to assess the health and growth stage of vegetation.

2.  **NDWI** is an index commonly used to monitor water, such as lakes and sea.

3.  Least Cost Corridor

    A Least Cost Corridor (LCC) is a path or route through a landscape that minimizes the cost of travel or movement between two points,taking into account various factors such as terrain, land cover, and human-made barriers. That means movement across a landscape is not uniform (the main principle of LCC). In ArcGIS Pro, we can create a Least Cost Corridor using the Spatial Analyst extension. See [arcgis pro documention](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/least-cost-corridor.htm) In future, I think that this skill can help to maintain connectivity between fragmented habitats, facilitating mobility and migration of animals. Meanwhile, in transport planning, this technique is able to construct the lower-cost roads as well as reducing environmental impacts (by bypassing mountains and water bodies), which can save the budget for building tunnels and bridges respectively.

4.  Accessibility of green space

    The accessibility of green space refers to the ease with which individuals or communities can reach and use green spaces such as parks, forests, gardens, and other natural or semi-natural areas.
