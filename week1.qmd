## Summary

### what is the RS

**Remote Sensing (RS)** == acquiring information from a distance by NASA

**Overall**:

-   Active and passive remote sensing

-   Considered how electromagnetic waves interact with

    -   Earth's surface

    -   Atmosphere

-   Explored the 4 resolutions of remotely sensed data

    -   Spectral

    -   Spatial

    -   Temporal

    -   Radiometric

-   Identified how constraints (environmental or sensor) can dictate the choice of data we use.

### two types of sensor:

**Passive:**

-   Use energy that is available

-   Don't emit anything

-   Detecting reflected energy from the sun

-   Energy is in electromagnetic waves

-   Such as: Human eye, camera, satellite sensor

**Active:**

-   Have an energy source for illumination

-   Actively emits electormagentic waves and then waits to receive

-   Such as: Radar, X-ray, LiDAR
