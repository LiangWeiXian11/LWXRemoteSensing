So if we take a beam of light such as that from the Sun, which contains multiple colours, then the shorter wavelengths (violet, indigo and blue light) are scattered more than the longer wavelengths such as orange and red.\n\n\n\n\nDifferent colors.

    "section": "3.1 Summary",
    "text": "3.1 Summary\nThis week we mainly talk about two main section, one is correction, another is about images enhancement. There are lots of reasons cause images become incorrect, which will bring lots of inconvenience in further analysis. All these factors will bring some obstacles for our following research. In that case, it is necessary to correct and enhance images. Although there are many methods which can improve the quality of images, different methods need to be chosen carefully for different scenarios and purposes.\n\n3.1.1 Corrections\n\n3.1.1.1 Geometric correction\nGeometric correction refers to the process of correcting distortions in spatial data, particularly in images or maps, to ensure accurate representation of the Earth’s surface. The goal of geometric correction is to align the features in the data with their true geographic locations.\nsome key points:\n\nSelection of Control Points\nControl points are identifiable features that have known geographic coordinates. These points are used to establish a relationship between the spatial data and the real-world coordinates.\nhow to select ?\nIn the spatial data, some clearly recognisable features or characteristics are selected, such as road intersections, building corners, river crossings, etc. These features should be clearly visible in the image and have a well-defined location geographically.\nTransformation Model\n-- the relationship between the control points (the spatial data) and their corresponding real-world coordinates. Common transformation models include polynomial transformations, affine transformations, or rubber sheeting.\nResampling\n\nNearest Neighbor\nLinear\nCubic\nCubic spline\n\n\nwe must re-sample the final raster because we can adjust the pixel values of the corrected image to the new pixel grid.\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Atmospheric correction\nAtmospheric corrections help to remove the effects of atmospheric media (which would reduce contrast of image) on remotely sensed images in order to obtain more accurate surface reflectance or radiance values, resulting in better contrast between images acquired at different times and locations.\nHow to do?\nDark object subtraction (DOS): Searches each band for the darkest value then subtracts that from each pixel. (Some objects’ DN values are theoretically 0, such as deep water bodies or shadows.Therefore, any value that it has can be attributed to the atmosphere and need to be removed.\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Topographic correction\nOrthorectification is a geometric correction process applied to satellite or aerial imagery to remove distortions caused by terrain variations, sensor viewing angles, and Earth curvature\n\n\n3.1.1.4 Radiometric correction\nconvert TOA radiance to TOA reflectance\n\nRadiance is how much light the sensor sees.\nReflectance is the ratio of light leaving the target to amount striking the target. Here will still have atmopsheric effects in the way of our true apparent reflectance. Confusingly all of these can be termed reflectance and indeed sometimes radiance is referred to as reflectance.\n\nThe purpose of radiometric correction is to standardize pixel values across an image, making it more consistent and suitable for quantitative analysis.\n\n\n3.1.1.5 Different level\n\nLevel 1 is delivered as a Digital Number (DN 值)\nLevel 2 includes surface reflectance and surface temperature\nLevel 3 science products are specific products generated from the data such as Burned Area, surface water extent\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 enhancement\n\n3.1.2.1 Radio\n\nNDVI: (NIR-RED) / (NIR+RED)\nNDWI: (NIR - SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR)\n( NIR is the reflectance in the near-infrared band; SWIR is the reflectance in the shortwave infrared band.)\n\n\n\n3.1.2.2 PCA\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is designed to reduce the dimensionality of our data.\nRunning the summary will given the proportion of variance explained by each PCA component and the cumulative proportion of the variance explained (from all the PCA layers compared to the original input data). Overall, PCA is trying to:\n\nTransform multi-spectral data into uncorrelated and smaller dataset\nKeep most of the original information\nThe first component will (should) capture most of the variance within the dataset\n\n“A big take-away from this is that system of linear equations are equivalent to a rotation of coordinate systems, which are change of perspective”\n\nPCA chooses the new axes sequentially one after another--PCA looks at the data from all possible angles and figures out which of the infinite number of perspectives spread out the data the most. The first new axis is the one which the data are maximally spread out. So the first new axis would have the most information for distinguishing the points from each other.\n“Loading is the correlation between an original variable and a principal component.”\nCracking Principal Components Analysis (PCA) — Part 2 | by Hyeon Gu Kim | Medium\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Filtering\n\nFiltering refers to any kind of moving window operation to our data which can be saved as a separate raster file. As we saw in the lecture this can include low or high pass filters.\n\n\n3.1.3.1 low pass\na smoothing (low-pass filter 低通滤波) algorithm will take the mean value of a 3-x-3 cell kernel, and place the output value in the location of the central cell.\n\n\n3.1.3.2 high pass\nEdge enhancement:\n\naccentuates or highlights the boundaries and edges of objects within an image.\nThe goal is to make the edges more visually prominent and improve the overall sharpness and clarity of the image\n\nWhere is edge? the change in pixel values"

With over 17 million people in an area of 962 square kilometers, it’s a bustling city. But, with all this growth, there are also challenges. Shenzhen has to find a balance between growing and taking care of the environment.\n\nDue to the high population density and intense socio-economic activities in Shenzhen, there’s significant disruption and pressure on the ecological environment. As a result, the overall fragmentation index of the ecological landscape keeps rising, leading to insufficient ecological connectivity between green spaces. This trend is causing ecological spaces to become isolated and fragmented, and there’s an urgent need to enhance the connectivity of ecological corridors.\nThe distribution of ecological recreational spaces is uneven, and there’s a need to improve accessibility and connectivity of facilities. Existing parks face challenges such as limited per capita green space resources and uneven development of green ecology in different areas. The quality and functionality of ecological recreational spaces need improvement. The connectivity of park networks and pedestrian accessibility also need to be enhanced.\n\nSource: Circular of the Shenzhen Municipal People’s Government on the Issuance of the Shenzhen Park City Construction Master Plan and Three-Year Action Plan (2022-2024)(深圳市人民政府关于印发深圳市公园城市建设总体规划暨三年行动计划（2022－2024年）的通知)\n\n\n4.1.2 Main policy challenges and targets\n\nImprove the quality of inefficient forests and young forests, accurately enhancing forest quality.\nIn natural suburban parks, we will nurture and thin out large areas of concentrated young forests to promote forest transformation. This includes promoting tree growth, removing low-quality trees, increasing forest quality and volume, and enhancing forest carbon storage.\nEnhance the quality of water conservation forests in important water source areas, strengthening soil and water conservation effects.\nWe will carry out forest transformation and nurturing of young forests around water conservation areas to improve the quality of fast-growing artificial forests and young forests.\nPromoting urban greening and upgrading greening quality\nAnalyze shortcomings in urban greening and identify key areas for the construction of tree-lined roads and vertical greening.\nPromoting the construction of boulevards\nComprehensively promote the construction and nurturing of boulevards on roads whose shade coverage rate does not meet the standards, enhance the coverage rate of boulevards in built-up areas of cities, and promote the linking of boulevards into pieces.\nConnecting mountain and water ecological corridor networks\n\nConnect natural mountain areas and green spaces through ecological green corridors or ecological bridges to promote connectivity of mountain forests and green corridors.\nUtilize nearby lakes and reservoirs along with surrounding mountain forest resources to create a network of suburban trails and lakeside pathways."
