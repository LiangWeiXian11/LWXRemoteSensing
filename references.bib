	abstract = {High-frequency Earth observation ({EO}) data have been shown to be eﬀective in identifying crops and monitoring their development. The purpose of this paper is to derive quantitative indicators of crop productivity using synthetic aperture radar ({SAR}). This study shows that the ﬁeld-speciﬁc {SAR} time series can be used to characterise growth and maturation periods and to estimate the performance of cereals. Winter wheat ﬁelds on the Rothamsted Research farm in Harpenden ({UK}) were selected for the analysis during three cropping seasons (2017 to 2019). Average {SAR} backscatter from Sentinel-1 satellites was extracted for each ﬁeld and temporal analysis was applied to the backscatter cross-polarisation ratio ({VH}/{VV}). The calculation of the diﬀerent curve parameters during the growing period involves (i) ﬁtting of two logistic curves to the dynamics of the {SAR} time series, which describe timing and intensity of growth and maturation, respectively; (ii) plotting the associated ﬁrst and second derivative in order to assist the determination of key stages in the crop development; and (iii) exploring the correlation matrix for the derived indicators and their predictive power for yield. The results show that the day of the year of the maximum {VH}/{VV} value was negatively correlated with yield (r = −0.56), and the duration of “full” vegetation was positively correlated with yield (r = 0.61). Signiﬁcant seasonal variation in the timing of peak vegetation (p = 0.042), the midpoint of growth (p = 0.037), the duration of the growing season (p = 0.039) and yield (p = 0.016) were observed and were consistent with observations of crop phenology. Further research is required to obtain a more detailed picture of the uncertainty of the presented novel methodology, as well as its validity across a wider range of agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {This study aims to examine the performance of Random Forest ({RF}) and Maximum Likelihood Classification ({MLC}) method to crop classification through pixel-based and parcel-based approaches. Analyses are performed on multispectral {SPOT} 5 image. First, the {SPOT} 5 image is classified using the classification methods in pixel-based manner. Next, the produced thematic maps are overlaid with the original agricultural parcels and the frequencies of the pixels within the parcels are computed. Then, the majority of the pixels are assigned as class label to the parcels. Results indicate that the overall accuracies of the parcel-based approach computed for the Random Forest method is 85.89\%, which is about 8\% better than the corresponding result of {MLC}.},
